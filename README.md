# etch-a-sketch
This project is a browser version of a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. It will showcase the DOM Manipulation skills I've learnt thus far.

Most of the elements and coding went into my JavaScript file to practice the DOM manipulation skills I had recently learnt. I kept the styling in the CSS file, ecxcept for the parts whereby the cursor moving changes the background color and when having to style the new cells generated from the user's input.

At first this project seemed straightforward and easy, until I had to write the code for every step/ small part for the overall project to work. Some of the challenges I faced were: 
1. Sizing the cells to fill out the grid container, and having the size stay proportional to the grid as one zooms in and out.
2. Getting the sizing of new cells generated to work and be proportional- since I realised I couldn't use the variable declared in JavaScript as a length variable in CSS for height and width.


Biggest takeaway from this was the importance of planning and using Pseudocode to breakdown the steps. Definitely took a bit of time for me to figure this out when I would try research a whole problem rather than breaking it into smaller steps. Also, I learnt that's quite beneficial to take a breather when you seem to keep hitting a brick wall. Viewing your code with a fresher set of eyes and a rested mind goes a long way in you solving a problem that's seemed unsolvable in the first place.
